                            <h2>First Galaxy Inc. was founded by Sam Huynh</h2>
                            <p>Defined by relationships and service, Sam approaches his career as a real estate broker differently than most brokers. His clients value him as an extraordinarily forthright and honest realtor with exceptional knowledge of
                                the marketplace, a fierce negotiator, proactive (instead of reactive) and able to foresee issues before they arise, then research and identify solutions.</p>
                            <p>Sam gets top-tier results by going above and beyond the demands of his job. As a real estate broker, he understands the challenges that occur in any transaction, especially in the midst of today’s volatile market. On a daily
                                basis, he treats both sellers and buyers with respect while helping them meet their real estate goals as quickly and easily as possible. He devotes himself to every aspect of each transaction, understanding that decent
                                communication is essential to creating a win for all parties involved. He also avoids the pitfalls of getting distracted by marketing or other real estate related activities when his focus should be on interactions with
                                clients. Amidst all the changes in an industry that rewards new sales technology and results from its agents, Sam’s integrity and high energy sets him apart from the pack as a trusted go-to source for his clients first,
                                but also as someone who is never afraid to speak up about issues or topics that will positively benefit others in the business community.</p>

                            <p>Sam is highly motivated and results-driven, with a proven track record of success. He demonstrates excellent interpersonal, analytical, and problem-solving skills. With his passion for building relationships and delivering
                                best-in-class service to each of his clients, Sam has a long list of happy buyers and sellers who continue to recommend him to their friends and family. Whether helping a buyer find a place to call home or easing a seller
                                through an emotional transition, he has undeniably made many happy buyers and sellers.</p>
                            <p>With an expansive knowledge of real estate, Sam has distinguished himself as one of the most knowledgeable, respected, and trusted brokers in the marketplace. His background has given him the knowledge and experience that every
                                client deserves, whether you are looking to buy or sell a property. With extensive experience in sales and marketing as well as construction, he knows how to help his clients navigate the industry with ease. He will be
                                there for you from the moment you decide to buy or sell, throughout showings and negotiations, and until the final sale. He understands that buying or selling a home is more than just a transaction: it’s a life-changing
                                venture.
